Create a two-panel cartoon-style digital illustration featuring the same two male characters: a casually dressed, worried man with messy hair (left side), and a confident man in a suit with neat hair (right side). In each panel, depict a contrasting financial scenario. Label the left side with a financial struggle or poor habit, and the right side with a financial win or good habit, using speech or title bubbles. Keep the background setting relevant to the scenario (e.g., desk, car lot, grocery store, ATM). Maintain the same cartoon art style and character design.
