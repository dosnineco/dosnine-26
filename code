Use clean, semantic HTML inside React components.

Pages must follow a consistent layout: title (h1), description paragraph (p), section headings (h2/h3), and content (lists, FAQs, forms, tools).

Apply a max page width of max-w-screen-md, centered (mx-auto), and paddings px-4 py-8 for standard page spacing.

Use TailwindCSS for all styling. Prioritize readability:

Title: text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6

Subheadings: text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 or text-xl font-semibold mb-4

Paragraphs: text-base text-gray-700 mb-4

Lists: list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-base

Always include SEO tags (<Head>) for every page: title, meta description, meta keywords, canonical link.

Add basic JSON-LD schema (where relevant), like SoftwareApplication or FAQPage markup.

Forms must use labeled inputs with accessible styling (larger clickable areas, clear contrast).

Components must prioritize mobile-first design (responsive padding, grid layout for larger screens, flex for small).

Include CTA buttons (px-6 py-3 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-600) with focus ring accessibility.

Use clear hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3) without skipping heading levels for SEO.

Keep the color palette simple and accessible: mainly blue accents, white backgrounds, gray text for body copy.
