✅ **Pre-sort photos** on your phone before selecting  
✅ **Use simple area names**: "Portmore" not "Portmore Phase 1 Near KFC"  
✅ **Keep notes short**: "Ground floor" not full descriptions  
✅ **Save templates** for common setups  
✅ **Default everything**: Set your usual parish, phone, description

### 5. Photo Distribution

**Example**: 10 listings, 5 photos each = 50 total photos needed

System automatically assigns:
- Listing 1: Photos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Listing 2: Photos 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
- Listing 3: Photos 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
- ...and so on

**No dragging. No manual sorting. Fast.**

### 7. Common Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Same Building, Different Units
```
Base: 2 bed apartment, St Catherine
Rows: Different prices/floors in same town
Photos: 5 per unit showing different interiors
```

#### Scenario B: Similar Properties, Different Areas
```
Base: 3 bed house, Kingston
Rows: Different neighborhoods, prices
Photos: 8 per property (exterior + interior shots)
```

#### Scenario C: Mixed Inventory
```
Base: 1 bed apartment, St James
Rows: Various Montego Bay areas
Photos: 3-5 per unit (quick turnover properties)
```

### 8. Troubleshooting

**"Add photos" error**: Must select at least some photos before publishing

**"Select a parish" error**: Parish is required in base data

**"At least one listing" error**: Need area + price in at least one row

**Wrong photo count**: System warns if insufficient photos, you can proceed with fewer

**Template not loading**: Templates saved in browser, clear cache if issues

---

### 9. Mobile Tips

**On a basic phone**:
- Use landscape mode for table input
- Zoom in on table cells for easier typing
- Tap "Add Row" after each filled row
- Photos: Use gallery's multi-select (long-press first photo, tap others)
- Publish button stays at bottom (scroll to see it)

**Works on**:
- iPhone Safari
- Android Chrome
- Basic browsers (no fancy JS needed)
- Slow connections (minimal uploads)
